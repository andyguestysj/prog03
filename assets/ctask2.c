  // 2 Print out the address of var using &var
  // 3 Print out the value stored in your pointer, ensure it is the same as the address from &var
  // 4 Print out the value of var
  // 5 Print out the value your pointer is pointing to using the * redirector
  // 6 After your printfs change the value stored in var using var =  and output the four printfs from 2-6 again. 
  // 7 Now change the value using your pointer and the * redirection. Again output the four printfs after to see what has changed.
