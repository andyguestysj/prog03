              <p class="lead">How is memory used by software? When we say we are storing a variable in memory what does 
                  that actually mean? Where are we storing it? How do we access it? Is everything stored the same way? 
                Is an integer stored the same way as a floating point number? How about a string? Or an object? 
                What about lists of data, how are they stored? How are they changed?</p>
                <p class="lead">This module will answer these questions and go on to look at what happens at the CPU level 
                    when every variable is stored as ones and zeroes.
