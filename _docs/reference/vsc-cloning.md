<centre>        
    <img src="{{ "/assets/img/git-clone1.png" | relative_url }}" alt="VSC Button Bar - Source Control Bar" class="img-responsive">
</centre>

Click on the **Clone Repository** button and enter the URL of the repository you wish to clone (for example https://git.ysjcs.net:8888/a.guest/c001hello.git) in the window that pops up.  

Select the folder, on your machine, you wish to clone the repository to. Note that this will create a folder within the selected folder. So if you have a ..\C-Code\ folder, select that and the repository will be cloned to a new folder in ..\C-Code\
