### Creating A Repository

The first thing you need to do is create a repository.  

1. Go to the [Gitlab Webpage](https://git.ysjcs.net:8888/users/sign_in) and sign in with your Linux username and password.
2. Click on the green **New Project** button at the top right of the screen. 
3. Enter a name for your repository in the **Project name** text box
4. Optionally - add a description in the description box 
5. Choose the visibility level
    * **Private** is fine for stuff like class exercises 
    * Assessment code should be **Internal** or **Public** so I can see them to mark them!
6. **DO NOT** check the box for the README file, it'll just screw things up.
7. Click the green **Create project** button. 

This will create an empty repository for you. To upload your code to it you will need the URL for the project. To get this click on the blue **Clone button** and copy the link under the heading **Clone with HTTPS**.
