## <a name="general"></a>repl.it

Given the current circumstances requiring social distancing we have very limited space in the labs and we cannot do side by side programming. Students cannot sit together to code and lecturers cannot sit with students to help them. The installed version of MS Teams does allow screen sharing which allows us to work remotely but that requires everyone to have access to the required software. We know from experience that students using Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, Netbeans, etc is problematic. It is very hard for us to support you installing the software and problems arise with getting code to run on different compilers.

We will be using the repl.it website for all coding on this module. repl.it is an online browser based compiler that supports a wide range of programming languages. Code is written directly in a browser, compiled and executed on repl.it's server and the output is sent back to the browser. This ensures that all students have access to the same software without installation issues. Additionally because the code is compiled and executed remotely on repl.it's servers it ensures that any computer with a browser and an internet connection can be used.  

You can sign up for a repl.it account for free at [https://repl.it/](https://repl.it/). I recommend you do so using your York St John email account address.

 repli.t can be embedded within a webpage. I will do this throughout the webpages for this module, allowing me to illustrate with runnable code. It will also be used for some exercises that accompany the lessons.  

Below is an example of repl.it running Java.

## <a name="newproj"></a>Creating A New Project

1. Log in to repl.it  
2. Click "+New repl" at the top of the lefh hand bar.  
3. Choose the language you wish to work in  
  * Assembly Language projects require a couple more steps, see below.
4. Enter a name for your project (repl.it calls projects "repl"s)  
5. Click create repl
6. You should be taken to your new project.

Your repl.it project should look like this when first set up.

### repl.it Layout

The bar on the left-hand side shows the files that are in the project.  
![alt text](/assets/img/replit-files.png "repl.it files list")
You can add new files (and folders) by clicking on the buttons next to "Files".   

On the side are three symbols.  
<i class="fa fa-file-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Files** shows you the files in your project  
<i class="fa fa-code-fork" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Version Control** takes you to your repository options  
<i class="fa fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Settings** shows project settings    

The centre section shows the content of the files in the project. This is your coding window.

The "Run" button in the middle of the top bar will compile and execute your project.

The right hand section shows the output of your. This includes the compile output. You can also enter commands here.
