## <a name="general"></a>repl.it

Given the current circumstances requiring social distancing we have very limited space in the labs and we cannot do side by side programming. Students cannot sit together to code and lecturers cannot sit with students to help them. The installed version of MS Teams does allow screen sharing which allows us to work remotely but that requires everyone to have access to the required software. We know from experience that students using Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, Netbeans, etc is problematic. It is very hard for us to support you installing the software and problems arise with getting code to run on different compilers.

We will be using the repl.it website for all coding on this module. repl.it is an online browser based compiler that supports a wide range of programming languages. Code is written directly in a browser, compiled and executed on repl.it's server and the output is sent back to the browser. This ensures that all students have access to the same software without installation issues. Additionally because the code is compiled and executed remotely on repl.it's servers it ensures that any computer with a browser and an internet connection can be used.  

You can sign up for a repl.it account for free at [https://repl.it/](https://repl.it/). I recommend you do so using your York St John email account address.
