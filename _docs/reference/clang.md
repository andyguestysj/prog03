## GNU C Compiler - gcc

**gcc** is the Unix/Linux command-line compiler. It is used to identify all the files to be compiled and built in to an application, from user defined source files to library files. It is often used by GUI based IDEs to actually do the compilation and building of applications.

## Makefiles

Using **gcc** can be complex and fiddly, especially with large projects with lots of source files and using multiple libraries. GUI based IDEs try to simplify this process with projects and build settings, another approach is to use *makefiles*.  

A *makefile* is a set of instructions for the *make* application. It details the source-files and libraries required to build an application.

## GNU Debugger - gdb

**gdb** is a command-line debugger for C (and C++). It isn't as user friendly as debugging using a GUI like Eclipse but it is very powerful when you know how to use it.
