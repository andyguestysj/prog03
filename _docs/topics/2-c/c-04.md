## Arithmetic Operators

| Operator	| Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| + | Adds two operands | A + B = 30 |
| − |Subtracts second operand from the first | A − B = -10 |
| * | Multiplies both operands | A * B = 200 |
| / | Divides numerator by de-numerator | B / A = 2 |
| % | Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division | B % A = 0 |
| ++ | Increment operator increases the integer value by one | A++ = 11 | 
| -- | Decrement operator decreases the integer value by one | A-- = 9 |

## Relational Operators

| Operator | Description | Example | 
| == | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If yes, then the condition becomes true. | (A == B) is not true. | 
| != | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true. | (A != B) is true. | 
| > | Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true. | (A > B) is not true. | 
| < | Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true. | (A < B) is true. | 
| >= | Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true. | (A >= B) is not true. | 
| <= | Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true. | (A <= B) is true. | 

## Logical Operators

| Operator | Description | Example | 
| && | Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true. | (A && B) is false. | 
| \|\| | Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands is non-zero, then the condition becomes true. | (A || B) is true. | 
| ! | Called Logical NOT Operator. It is used to reverse the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then Logical NOT operator will make it false. | !(A && B) is true. | 

## Bitwise Operators

| p | q | p & q	p | q | p ^ q |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
