## Arithmetic Operators

| Operator	| Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| + | Adds two operands | A + B = 30 |
| − |Subtracts second operand from the first | A − B = -10 |
| * | Multiplies both operands | A * B = 200 |
| / | Divides numerator by de-numerator | B / A = 2 |
| % | Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division | B % A = 0 |
| ++ | Increment operator increases the integer value by one | A++ = 11 | 
| -- | Decrement operator decreases the integer value by one | A-- = 9 |

#### Exercise 1

1. Log in to repl.it
2. Create a new repl. Make it a C program and call it `operators_demo`
3. Write code that demonstrates the operators above


## Relational Operators

| Operator | Description | Example | 
| == | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If yes, then the condition becomes true. | (A == B) is not true. | 
| != | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true. | (A != B) is true. | 
| > | Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true. | (A > B) is not true. | 
| < | Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true. | (A < B) is true. | 
| >= | Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true. | (A >= B) is not true. | 
| <= | Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true. | (A <= B) is true. | 

#### Exercise 2

1. Return to  `operators_demo`
2. Write code that demonstrates the operators above

## Logical Operators

| Operator | Description | Example | 
| && | Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true. | (A && B) is false. | 
| \|\| | Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands is non-zero, then the condition becomes true. | (A \|\| B) is true. | 
| ! | Called Logical NOT Operator. It is used to reverse the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then Logical NOT operator will make it false. | !(A && B) is true. | 

#### Exercise 3

1. Return to  `operators_demo`
2. Write code that demonstrates the operators above


## Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ is as follows −  
| p | q | p & q | p \| q | p ^ q |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |

Assume A = 60 and B = 13 in binary format, they will be as follows −  

```
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A = 1100 0011
```

The following table lists the bitwise operators supported by C. Assume variable 'A' holds 60 and variable 'B' holds 13, then −  

| Operator | Description | Example | 
| & | Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands | (A & B) = 12, i.e., 0000 1100 | 
| \| | Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand | (A \| B) = 61, i.e., 0011 1101 | 
| ^ | Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both | (A ^ B) = 49, i.e., 0011 0001 | 
| ~ | Binary One's Complement Operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits | (~A ) = ~(60), i.e,. -0111101 | 
| << | Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand | A << 2 = 240 i.e., 1111 0000 | 
| >> | Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand | A >> 2 = 15 i.e., 0000 1111 | 

#### Exercise 4

2. Write code that demonstrates the operators above


## Assignment Operators

| Operator | Description | Example | 
| = | Simple assignment operator. Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand | C = A + B will assign the value of A + B to C | 
| += | Add AND assignment operator. It adds the right operand to the left operand and assign the result to the left operand | C += A is equivalent to C = C + A | 
| -= | Subtract AND assignment operator. It subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand | C -= A is equivalent to C = C - A | 
| *= | Multiply AND assignment operator. It multiplies the right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand | C *= A is equivalent to C = C * A | 
| /= | Divide AND assignment operator. It divides the left operand with the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand | C /= A is equivalent to C = C / A | 
| %= | Modulus AND assignment operator. It takes modulus using two operands and assigns the result to the left operand | C %= A is equivalent to C = C % A | 
| <<= | Left shift AND assignment operator | C <<= 2 is same as C = C << 2 | 
| >>= | Right shift AND assignment operator | C >>= 2 is same as C = C >> 2 | 
| &= | Bitwise AND assignment operator | C &= 2 is same as C = C & 2 | 
| ^= | Bitwise exclusive OR and assignment operator | C ^= 2 is same as C = C ^ 2 | 
| \|= | Bitwise inclusive OR and assignment operator | C \|= 2 is same as C = C \| 2 | 

## Misc Operators
Included here for completeness, well explain these later.

| Operator | Description | Example | 
| sizeof() | Returns the size of a variable | sizeof(a), where a is integer, will return 4. | 
| & | Returns the address of a variable | &a; returns the actual address of the variable. | 
| * | Pointer to a variable | *a; | 
| ?: | Conditional Expression | If Condition is true ? then value X : otherwise value Y |
