#### Exercise 1 - Morse Code Generator

1. Log in to repl.it
2. Create a new repl. Make it a C program and call it `morse_code`
3. Write an application that reads in a string of text from the keyboard and converts it to morse code, outputting one the morse for each character on a separate line. The test should consist of only lower case characters and spaces.
