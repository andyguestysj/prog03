Since we know how to use printf() to write output we can start looking at the rest of the C Language.  

## Comments

Comments, like in Java, come in two forms. Block comments and rest of the line comments

**Block Comments**
```c
/* Block comments begin with slash asterisk
   and keep going
   until you reach an asterisk slash */
```
**To End Of Line Comments**
```c
printf("Hello World"); // Comments from // to end of line
```

## Variables

Variables are going to look very familiar to variables in Java. We've already used a couple of different variables, we're going to cover the basics of how variables are used and look at some more advanced features that will come in useful later on.  

### Types

| Variable Type | Descriptiop |
| --- | --- |
| char | a byte holding a single character |
| int | integer |
| float | single precision floating point number |
| double | double precision floating point number |
| bool | single boolean value (see Boolean section below) |
| void | represents the absence of type |

These are the basic variables, the equivalent of Java's primitives. We can create more types and we will do that later on.  

Note that there is no string variable. C does not have a string variable at all. Instead C uses arrays of characters. We will look at arrays soon and using arrays of characters as strings for later on.  

### Defining Variables

Again this is very similar to Java. We define variables by type and can initialise them immeadiately or later.  

```c
int    i, j, k;
char   c, ch;
float  f, salary;
double d;
```
```c
int d = 3, f = 5;           // definition and initializing d and f. 
byte z = 22;                // definition and initializes z. 
char x = 'x';               // the variable x has the value 'x'.
```

#### extern Declaration
The **extern** keyword can be used to declare that a variable will exist without actually creating it. We don't do this often but sometimes it is useful to let the compiler know that a variable will be created at some point and not to worry about it for the time being.  

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Variable declaration but not creation
extern int a, b;
extern int c;
extern float f;

int main () 
{
  // variable definition: (creation but not initialisation)

  int a, b;
  int c;
  float f;

  /* actual initialisation */
  a = 10;
  b = 20;

  c = a + b;
  printf("value of c : %d \n", c);

  f = 70.0/3.0;
  printf("value of f : %f \n", f);

  return 0;
}
```
