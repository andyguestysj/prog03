## Arrays

Arrays are created as follows.  

```c 
int iNumArray[3];
int iNum[5] = {1,5,2,4,3};
int Numbers[] = {3,6,2,8,7};
```
You can specify the size of the array explicitly or leave it blank and let the compiler define so it is big enough to store the initial data. The initial declaration must determine the size one way or another though.  

```c
int anArray[];
```
is not valid.  

Values in the array can be read or altered using an *index* value;

```c
int Numbers[] = {3,6,2,8,7};
printf("%d\n", Numbers[2]);
Numbers[3] = 1;
```

### Arrays and Addresses

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {

int a[] = {1,1,1,1,1};
int b[] = {2,2,2,2,2};
int c[] = {3,3,3,3,3};

for (int i=0;i<5;i++)
{
  printf("array a[%d] %d at address %p\n",i,a[i], &a[i]);
}
printf("\n");

for (int i=0;i<5;i++)
{
  printf("array b[%d] %d at address %p\n",i,b[i], &b[i]);
}
printf("\n");

for (int i=0;i<5;i++)
{
  printf("array c[%d] %d at address %p\n",i,c[i], &c[i]);
}
printf("\n");

printf("\n");
printf("array c[%d] %d at address %p\n",0,a[0], &a[0]);
printf("array c[%d] %d at address %p\n",0,b[0], &b[0]);
printf("array c[%d] %d at address %p\n",0,c[0], &c[0]);

return 0;
}
```
Running the code above shows us a few of different things.  

Items in an array are stored sequentially. Integers take up four bytes in memory, the addresses of items in an integer array are four bytes apart. The array is stored in increasing memory addresses.  

When arrays are created one after another they are spaced so that the beginning is properly aligned. Each subsequent is stored in lower memory addresses.

```console
array a[0] 1 at address 0x7ffcb9621980
array a[1] 1 at address 0x7ffcb9621984
array a[2] 1 at address 0x7ffcb9621988
array a[3] 1 at address 0x7ffcb962198c
array a[4] 1 at address 0x7ffcb9621990

array b[0] 2 at address 0x7ffcb9621960
array b[1] 2 at address 0x7ffcb9621964
array b[2] 2 at address 0x7ffcb9621968
array b[3] 2 at address 0x7ffcb962196c
array b[4] 2 at address 0x7ffcb9621970

array c[0] 3 at address 0x7ffcb9621940
array c[1] 3 at address 0x7ffcb9621944
array c[2] 3 at address 0x7ffcb9621948
array c[3] 3 at address 0x7ffcb962194c
array c[4] 3 at address 0x7ffcb9621950


array c[0] 1 at address 0x7ffcb9621980
array c[0] 2 at address 0x7ffcb9621960
array c[0] 3 at address 0x7ffcb9621940
```

### C Array Bounds

The `bounds` of an array are the valid indexes that can be used to access the array.  

```c
int Numbers[] = {3,6,2,8,7};
```

`Numbers[]` above has a length of five, with valid indexes from 0 to 4.  

C however, will let you access *invalid indexes* that are outwith the bounds of the array.  

```c
int Numbers[] = {3,6,2,8,7};

Numbers[10] = 1;
Numbers[-2] = 1;
```

The compiler will *warn* you that the index is out of bounds but it will not stop you doing this. Doing this may cause your code to crash or may work. If it works its results may be unpredictable. For example the following code (available at [https://repl.it/@andyguest/cArrayBoundaryOverrun](https://repl.it/@andyguest/cArrayBoundaryOverrun))  

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {

int a[] = {1,1,1,1};
int b[] = {2,2,2,2};

for (int i=0;i<4;i++)
{
  printf("array a[%d] %d at address %p\n",i,a[i], &a[i]);
}
printf("\n");

for (int i=0;i<4;i++)
{
  printf("array b[%d] %d at address %p\n",i,b[i], &b[i]);
}
printf("\n");

for (int i=0; i<8; i++)
{
  b[i]=3;
  printf("setting array b[%d] to %d at address %p\n",i,b[i], &b[i]);
}
printf("\n");

for (int i=0;i<4;i++)
{
  printf("array a[%d] %d at address %p\n",i,a[i], &a[i]);
}
printf("\n");

for (int i=0;i<4;i++)
{
  printf("array b[%d] %d at address %p\n",i,b[i], &b[i]);
}
printf("\n");

return 0;

}
```

produces the following output  

```console
array a[0] 1 at address 0x7fff4d2abdc0
array a[1] 1 at address 0x7fff4d2abdc4
array a[2] 1 at address 0x7fff4d2abdc8
array a[3] 1 at address 0x7fff4d2abdcc

array b[0] 2 at address 0x7fff4d2abdb0
array b[1] 2 at address 0x7fff4d2abdb4
array b[2] 2 at address 0x7fff4d2abdb8
array b[3] 2 at address 0x7fff4d2abdbc

setting array b[0] to 3 at address 0x7fff4d2abdb0
setting array b[1] to 3 at address 0x7fff4d2abdb4
setting array b[2] to 3 at address 0x7fff4d2abdb8
setting array b[3] to 3 at address 0x7fff4d2abdbc
setting array b[4] to 3 at address 0x7fff4d2abdc0
setting array b[5] to 3 at address 0x7fff4d2abdc4
setting array b[6] to 3 at address 0x7fff4d2abdc8
setting array b[7] to 3 at address 0x7fff4d2abdcc

array a[0] 3 at address 0x7fff4d2abdc0
array a[1] 3 at address 0x7fff4d2abdc4
array a[2] 3 at address 0x7fff4d2abdc8
array a[3] 3 at address 0x7fff4d2abdcc

array b[0] 3 at address 0x7fff4d2abdb0
array b[1] 3 at address 0x7fff4d2abdb4
array b[2] 3 at address 0x7fff4d2abdb8
array b[3] 3 at address 0x7fff4d2abdbc
```

The array `b[]` is declared immeadiately after the array `a[]`, so `b[]` is at a lower memory address than `a[]` and expands up towards `a[]`.  

|Address|Array|Value|
|---|---|---|
|..b0|b[0]|2|
|..b4|b[1]|2|
|..b8|b[2]|2|
|..bc|b[3]|2|
|..c0|a[0]|1|
|..c4|a[1]|1|
|..c8|a[2]|1|
|..cc|a[3]|1|

|Array|Address|Value
|b[i]|&b[i]||
|---|---|---|
|b[0]|..b0|2|
|b[1]|..b4|2|
|b[2]|..b8|2|
|b[3]|..bc|2|
|b[4]|..c0|1|
|b[5]|..c4|1|
|b[6]|..c8|1|
|b[7]|..cc|1|

So we have to be very careful with array bounds. Writing too much data in to an array can overwrite previously declared variables. More than that, remember the way the frame is created on the stack.  

<centre><img src="/assets/img/topic3/framestruct2.png" alt="C Memory- Frame structure"></centre>

Before the variables for a function are created in a frame, variables that store the passed in parameters are created and before that the return address is stored. Write enough data in to an array and you can overwrite the return address causing your code to crash.  

There are safeguards in place to try to prevent this from causing too much damage, but a **buffer overflow attack** can deliberately overwrite the return address so the code doesn't return to the correct place and instead ends up executing malicious code.   

We have to be especially careful with strings since strings are actually character arrays terminated by a `\0`. If we accidentally remove the `\0` the code does not know when the string ends. We also have to be careful reading text input and ensure that we do not store a string that is too long in a character array.  

## Pointer Arithmetic

When we create a pointer we create a pointer to a specific type of variable.  

```c
int i_value = 5;
int *i_pointer = &i_value;


i_pointer++;

```

So what does the line `i_pointer++;` do? We know `i_value++;` would increment the number stored in `i_value` by one. Does `i_pointer++;` increase the pointer value by one, moving it to the next byte of memory? No it doesn't, it *increases the address by the size of the variable type it is based on*. `i_pointer` is a pointer to an `int` type, an `int` has a size of 4 bytes. Therefore `i_pointer++` increases the value of 'i_pointer' by 4. If we had a pointer to a character `char *c_pointer` then `c_pointer++` would increase the pointer value by 1 (since the size of a char is 1 byte).  

Why is this useful? Well one place it is useful is in arrays.  

```c
#include <stdio.h> 

int main() 
{ 
  int i; 
  int a[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; 
  int *p = &a[0]; 

  for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) 
  { 
    printf("%d", *p); 
    p++; 
  } 
  return 0; 
} 
```

If we start by creating a pointer to the first element in an array we can then access the array contents directly using the pointer and incrementing it as needed. Note that this also works with `p=p+1`.  

## Multidimensional Arrays

A multidimensional array is of form, `a[i][j]`.  

```c
int a[10][15];

for (int i=0;i<10;i++)
{
  for (int j=0;j<15;j++)
  {
    a[i][j] = (i+15)+j;  /* fill up the array with increasing numbers */
  }
}
```

We can get a pointer to the address of any element in an array with `&a[i][j]`. Can we use pointer arithmetic to access it?  

Yes we can because of the way arrays are stored in memory.  A one dimensional array is stored as consecutive values in memory. A two dimensional array is stored as an array of one dimensional arrays stored as consecutive values in memory. What does this mean? Well starting from the first element in the array, `a[0][0]` each element in `a[0]` is stored. `a[0][0], a[0][1],a[0][2], .. a[0][14]`. Immeadiately after `a[0][14]` the entry for `a[1][0]` is stored, followed by the rest of the `a[1]`'s in order and so one. So far as the memory allocation is concerned a multidimensional array is just a one dimensional array with `i*j` entries.  

This means we can step through the array in a single loop rather than using nested loops. (Nested loops are very useful but they are slower than single loops).  

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int a[10][15];
  int *ptr = &a[0][0];

  for (int i=0;i<(10*15);i++)
  {
    *(ptr + i)=i;
  }

  for (int i=0;i<10;i++)
  {
    for (int j=0;j<15;j++)
    {
      printf("%d, ",a[i][j]);
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

The single loop sets each value in the multi-dimesional array by iterating through `rows * cols` positions, adding on one more in each loop to a pointer set to the start of the array `int *ptr = &a[0][0]`.  The alternate method, used to print out the results, uses nested loops, looping through each entry in each column for each row. `a[i][j]` equates to `*(ptr + (i * col_count) + j)`.

## Arrays Of Pointers

We can also make arrays of pointers. There are a number of reasons to do this, here we will consider one useful example, an array of pointers to strings.  

Imagine we want an array of strings.  

```c
char name[3][20] = {"Adam", "Chris", "Deniel"};
```

What this would give us in memory, illustrated as a row for each string and a column for each character, is.
