## C Variables

C variables have a fixed size in memory.  

|Type|Stores|Size|
|---|---|---|
|int|integer number|4-bytes|
|short|integer number|2-bytes|
|long|integer number|8-bytes|
|char|character|1-byte|
|float|floating point number|4-bytes|
|double|floating point number|8-bytes|
|void *|pointers|8-bytes on (64 bit machines)|

## Arrays

Arrays are created as follows.  
```c 
int iNumArray[3];
int iNum[5] = {1,5,2,4,3};
int Numbers[] = {3,6,2,8,7};
```
You can specify the size of the array explicitly or leave it blank and let the compiler define so it is big enough to store the initial data. The initial declaration must determine the size one way or another though.  
```c
int anArray[];
```
is not valid.  

Values in the array can be read or altered using an *index* value;
```c
int Numbers[] = {3,6,2,8,7};
printf("%d\n", Numbers[2]);
Numbers[3] = 1;
```

Note that C will let you access *indexes* that are outwith the bounds of the array.

```c
int Numbers[] = {3,6,2,8,7};

Numbers[10] = 1;
Numbers[-2] = 1;
```
The compiler will *warn* you that the index is out of bounds but it will not stop you doing this. Doing this may cause your code to crash or may work. If it works its results may be unpredictable. For example the following code (available at [https://repl.it/@andyguest/cArrays](https://repl.it/@andyguest/cArrays))  

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {

int a[] = {1,1,1};
int Numbers[] = {3,6,2,8,7};
int b[] = {2,2,2};


for (int i=-5;i<10;i++)
{
  printf("[%d] [%d]\n",i,Numbers[i]);
}

return 0;
}
```
produces the following output  
```console
[-5] [0]
[-4] [-4]
[-3] [2]
[-2] [2]
[-1] [2]
[0] [3]
[1] [6]
[2] [2]
[3] [8]
[4] [7]
[5] [0]
[6] [4195328]
[7] [0]
[8] [1]
[9] [1]

```
Why does this happen? Well two things are coming in to play here - how an array is stored in memory and how variables declared next to each other are stored in memory.  

### Arrays In Memory

An array is stored in sequential, contiguous spaces in memory. Each item in an array takes up a number of bytes based on its type and the next item in the array is stored immeadiately after the previous one.

### Variables In Memory
When we declared variables one after another they are stored in memory consecutively, or at least kind of consecutively. Every variable type has an *alignment requirement*. This *alignment requirement* is the minimum space, in bytes, that must occur between variables of the same type.  

The alignment requirement of an array of integers is 4 bytes.  

So taking these two things together and looking at the above example  
```c
int a[] = {1,1,1};
int Numbers[] = {3,6,2,8,7};
int b[] = {2,2,2};
```
we have three arrays of integers. These are added in to memory with a gap of four bytes between them.
