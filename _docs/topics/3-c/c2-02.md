## Pointers to Memory Addresses

C allows us to work directly with memory addresses. On the previous page wee used this to view the location variables are stored in.  

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdalign.h>

int main(void) {

int integer1=1;
int integer2=2;
int integer3=3;

printf("integer1 = %d Memory address %p\n",integer1,&integer1);
printf("integer2 = %d Memory address %p\n",integer2,&integer2);
printf("integer3 = %d Memory address %p\n",integer3,&integer3);

return 0;
}
```

```console
integer1 = 1 Memory address 0x7ffe196e4ad8
integer2 = 2 Memory address 0x7ffe196e4ad4
integer3 = 3 Memory address 0x7ffe196e4ad0
```

We can use the ampersand `&` to get the memory address of a variable. We can store the address in a `pointer`. A `pointer` is a variable whose value is the address of another variable. The general form of a pointer declaration is -  
`type *var-name;`  
`type` is the pointer's base type, based on the data being stored at the memory address. We use an asterisk 

```c
int     *intPointer;      /* Pointer to an integer */
double  *dblPointer;      /* Pointer to a double */
float   *fltPointer;      /* Pointer to an float */
char    *chrPointer;      /* Pointer to an char */
```

The code above can be written using pointer variables.

```c
int  integer1 = 1;
int* integer1_p = &integer1;

printf("integer1 = %d Memory address %p\n", integer1, integer1_p);
```

## Using Pointers

We can use the memory address, the pointer, to access the contents of the memory. We use the asterisk to ask the data from the pointer. 

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {

  int var = 20;    /* actual variable declaration */
  int \*ip;        /* pointer variable declaration */

  ip = &var;       /* store address of var in pointer variable*/

  printf("value of var variable: %d\n", var);

  printf("Address of var variable: %p\n", &var  );

  /* address stored in pointer variable */
  printf("Address stored in ip variable: %p\n", ip );

  /* access the value using the pointer */
  printf("Value of *ip variable: %d\n", *ip );

  return 0;
}
```

```console
value of var variable: 20
Address of var variable: 0x7ffe00b8ca08
Address stored in ip variable: 0x7ffe00b8ca08
Value of *ip variable: 20
```


|---|---|---|
|*(&i)|&i|i|
|Value|Address|Value|
