## Java Memory Exercise

The [**Java Visualizer**](https://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/java_visualize/#) allows you to run Java code line by line and see what is happening on the stack and heap. 

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">    
    <ul>
<li>The Java code is shown on the left, in the green section</li>
<li>Next to it, in the red section, the stack is shown</li>
<li>Next to that (in purple), the heap is shown</li>
<li>At the bottom (in brown) the controls</li>
</ul>
    </div>
