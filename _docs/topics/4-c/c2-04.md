## Strings are Arrays of Characters

Strings in C are represented by a one dimensional array of characters that are terminated by a null character `\0`.   

```c
char greet[6] = {'H','e','l','l','o','\0'};
char greet[] = "Hello"; // null character \0 added automatically


char greet[6];
greet = "Hello"; // Will not work - the `strcpy()` function must be used instead.
```

Strings, like all arrays, are stored in consecutive spaces in memory.

## String Functions

From the `#include<string.h>` library.  

|Function|What it does|
|---|---|
|strcpy(s1,s2);|Copies s2 in to s1|
|strcat(s1,s2);|Concatenates s2 on to s1|
|strlen(s1);|Returns length of s1|
|strcmp(s1,s2);|Compares s1 & s2, 0 if same|
|strchr(s1,ch);|Returns a pointer to the first ch in s1|
|strstr(s1,s2);|Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of s2 in s1|

## scanf() to read a string

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    char name[20];
    printf("Enter name: ");
    scanf("%s", name);
    printf("Your name is %s.", name);
    return 0;
}
```

```console
Enter name: Dennis Ritchie
Your name is Dennis.
```

Even though `Dennis Ritchie` was entered in the above program, only "Dennis" was stored in the `name` string. It's because there was a space after Dennis.

## fgets() to read a line og text

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    char name[30];
    printf("Enter name: ");
    fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);  // read string
    printf("Name: ");
    puts(name);    // display string
    return 0;
}
```

```console
Enter name: Tom Hanks
Name: Tom Hanks
```

Here, we have used `fgets()` function to read a string from the user.  

```c
fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdlin); // read string
```

The `sizeof(name)` results to 30. Hence, we can take a maximum of 30 characters as input which is the size of the name string. We specify the length of the target string to prevent buffer overflow.  The function `gets()` has been removed from the C standard as it allows any length of string to be read in and can easily cause buffer overflows.
