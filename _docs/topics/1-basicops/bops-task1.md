### Linux, C & Visual Studio Code

We're going to be programming in the C programming language in this module. We'll start learning some C in a couple of weeks time but we can do some preparation this week.  

#### Linux

We will be using the Linux operating system. The PCs in this lab (and in CD105) are set up as dual boot machines. You can boot them in to Windows or Linux, specifically the Unbuntu variant of Linux. If you've already booted in to Linux congratulations, you've completed the first part of this task. If you are in Windows you'll need to reboot the machine and choose the Ubuntu option during the start up. Remeber you'll need to use your Linux/Computing account.  

**Linux** is based on the Unix operating system. It is available for free from [https://ubuntu.com/](https://ubuntu.com/). Installing Ubuntu and setting it up can be a bit tricky/fiddly and you need to be careful that you don't overwrite your Windows setup if you want your own PC/laptop to dual boot Windows & Linux. Installation instructions are here [https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview).  

Alternatively you can install Ubuntu to a USB stick and boot from that. Instructions here [https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/try-ubuntu-before-you-install#1-getting-started](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/try-ubuntu-before-you-install#1-getting-started).  

We'll pick up some Linux/Ubuntu skills along the way.  

#### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (VSC) is an text based code editor. It is available for Windows, Linux and Mac from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  

VSC has many extensions available for it, making it usable as an editor for most programming languages, scripting and most other things.  

We'll be using the extensions listed below
* C/C++ v1.6.0
* GitLens v11.6.0
  
You might find the extensions below useful
* Bracket Pair Colourizer v1.0.61
* PlantUML v2.15.1
* Prettier - Code Formatter v.9.0.0

NB These are the version numbers I have installed. There may be newer versions.  

**Installing Extensions**

When you have VSC open click on the Extensions button in the icon bar down the left hand side of the screen.  

<centre>        
    <img src="{{ "/assets/img/vsc-ext.png" | relative_url }}" alt="VSC Button Bar" class="img-responsive">
    <img src="{{ "/assets/img/ext-btn.png" | relative_url }}" alt="VSC Button Bar - Extension Button" class="img-responsive">
</centre>

This will open up the Extensions side bar.  

<centre>        
    <img src="{{ "/assets/img/ext-bar.png" | relative_url }}" alt="VSC - Extension Bar" class="img-responsive">
</centre>

Type the name of the extension you want to install in the text box at the top of the Extension Bar and click the blue install button for the extension.
