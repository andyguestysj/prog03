### Primitives

In Java the simplest type of data structure we can use are simple variables. These simple variables store a single piece of information such as a number, a character or a true/false boolean value. We call these **primitives** or **primitive types**. All data stored in Java is ultimately stored in primitives.   

Java has eight primitive types: '''boolean''', '''byte''', '''char''', '''short''', '''int''', '''long''', '''float''' and '''double'''.
