We will be using assorted software and programming tools in this module. This page will link to resources for the software and tools.  

## Moodle

The Moodle page for this module is the key information source. It will have the assessment brief, deadlines, submission information and assessment feedback.  

If there are any contradictions between Moodle and other sources the Moodle information should be considered correct. 

## Website

The content for the module will be provided through the Programming 03 webpage [https://ysjprog03.netlify.app/](https://ysjprog03.netlify.app/). Moodle isn't suitable for presenting the information, videos and tutorials required. There is a link to the webpage on Moodle.

## eMail

eMail is the primary communication method for this module. Please check your email each week day so we can update you on any changes. I advise checking your email shortly before any timetabled session in case of changes.  

The best way to contact me is via [email](mailto:a.guest@yorksj.ac.uk). You can also message me through MS Teams.

## Microsoft Teams

MS Teams will be used for all face to face contact. Lab/tutorial session will be run as live MS Teams sessions. Please install MS Teams on your machines if you can, the web version is limited and a bit flaky.  

## repl.it

[repl.it reference page](../replit/replit.html)

Given the current circumstances requiring social distancing we have very limited space in the labs and we cannot do side by side programming. Students cannot sit together to code and lecturers cannot sit with students to help them. The installed version of MS Teams does allow screen sharing which allows us to work remotely but that requires everyone to have access to the required software. We know from experience that students using Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, Netbeans, etc is problematic. It is very hard for us to support you installing the software and problems arise with getting code to run on different compilers.

We will be using the repl.it website for all coding on this module. repl.it is an online browser based compiler that supports a wide range of programming languages. Code is written directly in a browser, compiled and executed on repl.it's server and the output is sent back to the browser. This ensures that all students have access to the same software without installation issues. Additionally because the code is compiled and executed remotely on repl.it's servers it ensures that any computer with a browser and an internet connection can be used.  

You **can** come in to the labs, during your timetabled sessions, if you wish or do not have access to a machine at home. Be aware that I will not be in the labs, I will be running the session remotely. You will also need to bring headphones to use, ideally with built-in microphone if you want to speak to me or other students.  

You can sign up for a repl.it account for free at [https://repl.it/](https://repl.it/). I recommend you do so using your York St John email account address.  

The repl.it page on this site contains instructions and tips for using repl.it.  

## Git

We will be using Git again to store code repositories and submit code. repl.it has very good integration with GitHub and can pull and push code from our GitLab (with a little bit of setup). Information on how to do this is on the repl.it page.
